## How I work

I'm at my best with complex problems and projects that span multiple domains, where specialized jargon needs to be understood and translated into technical solutions. I design first, then implement. Clean code, proven design patterns.

I know my applications inside and out.

I prefer working in small, tight-knit teams that can handle everything themselves, or alone. No strict separation between frontend, backend, database, operations. Direct communication and personal contact instead of calls with too many people.

## Background

I studied economics and international relations at Ghent University. In my final year I came into contact with TenderWolf and started programming. Not from a computer science background, but on the job. I see that background as a strength: I think broader than code alone.

At TenderWolf I started with a small project within a larger application. Gradually I grew into lead engineer and later shareholder. For ten years I helped build the procurement platform: design, analysis, implementation, testing, deployment, database, everything.

In 2019 I started Fiscalo with a few friends as a side project. During the corona lockdowns it took off. Fiscalo is a payroll application for Belgian accountants: a translation of complex fiscal legislation into workable software.

## Ghent

I live and work in Ghent. The bike is my commute. Proximity and personal contact are not a luxury for me, but how I prefer to work.
